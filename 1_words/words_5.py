print('hello world')
print()

#this is a variable
num_1 = '5'

num_2 = '5'

#what do you think this prints
print(num_1 + num_2)

#i'm not really trying to trick you. obviously you know arithmetic and how to add 5 + 5
#the question is straightforward, do you think it will print 10 yes or no? if no, what does it print? why? 


#strings are words!
print(type(num_1))

#printing multiple things at a time
#print(type(num_1), type(num_2))
